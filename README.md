# Network Configuration Generator 🌍🚀

![Helper-X.app](images/logo.svg)

Welcome to the Network Configuration Generator! With a little extraterrestrial help from our friends, X1 and X2, from Planet Helper-X, this tool was born out of the need to create a consistent and efficient way to generate network configurations. Ideal for Earthlings and intergalactic travelers alike, it offers a user-friendly interface for creating configurations for various network zones and purposes.

## Overview 🌐

In the age of smart devices, it's crucial to have a segmented network. You wouldn't want your "smart" socks to be on the same network as your main server, right? 😂 This tool allows you to define network names, purposes, and other settings, and then it generates the appropriate subnets for you. It's designed to be flexible, scalable, and, most importantly, a bit fun!

## Features 🌟

- Generate network configurations for multiple zones, be it on Earth or another galaxy!
- User-friendly web-based interface, approved by X1 and X2.
- Dockerized for easy setup and deployment across the universe.
- Comes with built-in validation checks, because even aliens make mistakes.

## How It Works 🔧

1. **Input Data**: Through a web interface, you can input network names and their purposes. For instance:
   - Network Name: "Main Server"
   - Purpose: "Hosting the main application"

2. **Generate**: Once you've entered all your networks, hit the "Generate" button.

3. **View Results**: The tool will then provide you with the appropriate subnets based on your input and the settings defined in `settings.json`.

## Behind the Scenes 🌌

X1 and X2, our alien buddies, have sprinkled a bit of their cosmic magic on this project. They believe that while the universe is vast and complex, network configurations don't have to be!

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- Python (the universal language, right?)
- Flask (light as a UFO!)
- Docker (for containerizing intergalactic code)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for that earthly touch)
